* What's the plan? - Day 1 of AOC 2022
** Objective 
 * A useful idea is to use the demo text *then* build code based off that. 
 * I'm typing with dvorak and it is very painful :3
 * Find the elf with the _most_ calories and _how many calories is the elf carrying?_

** Pseudo-code 

#+begin_src
 public class {
   int oldCount = 0;
   int maxCount = 0;
   Scanner s = new Scanner();
   File file = new File(list.txt);

   for (line : list.txt) {
     oldCount += s.nextInt();
 
     if (s.nextWhitespace() && oldCount >= maxCount) {
       oldCount.isequals(maxCount);
   }
  }
    System.out.println(toString.(maxCount));
 }
